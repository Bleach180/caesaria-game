 text  : "Even the largest, most luxurious villas were sparsely furnished. Romans preferred to recline, even when dining, so their furniture was mainly a profusion of cushions. The few chairs, tables and beds that they desired were simple wooden items, usually home-made by slaves. The Roman furniture industry was small and specialized, and its products more curios than necessities."
