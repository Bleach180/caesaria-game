 text  : "@Aqueducts& brought water from remote hills to @reservoirs&, which distributed it through ceramic, wooden or lead pipes to public @fountains&. These provided free water for most of Rome's citizens, and were often elaborate monuments to famous people and events, real and mythical. Constructing a fountain in someone's honor was such a common form of tribute that Rome eventually had more than 1,200 public fountains, most of them works of art."
